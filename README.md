1.Motivation: Predicting the outcome of a match has always been at
the centre of sports analytics. Indian Premier League (IPL), a
professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in India, has established
itself as one of the biggest tournaments in cricket history.
2.Objectives: In this paper, we propose a model to predict the winner
at the end of each over in the second innings of an IPL cricket match.
3.Method: Our methodology not only incorporates the dynamically
updating game context as the game progresses, but also includes the
relative strength between the two teams playing the match.
Estimating the relative strength between two teams involves
modelling the individual participating players' potentials. To model
a player, we use his career as well as recent performance statistics.
4.Results: Using the various dynamic features, we evaluate several
supervised learning algorithms to predict the winner of the match.
Finally, using seven ML algorithms, we achieved an accuracy of
81%-95%with an overall accuracy of 83.42%
